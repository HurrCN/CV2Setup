Here are steps to make things ready.
1. Download all from these links :
  - https://github.com/opencv/opencv/archive/4.5.5.zip for openCV 4.5.5
  - https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib.git and then choose the correct version on TAG
  - https://cmake.org/download/ get the latest version of cmake
2. Now, make a directory to gather all of these right on the C:\YourFolderName\, say, C:\openCV\. Never put inside C:\Program Files\ because it will fail the build
3. Make new folder inside, say, C:\openCV\build.
4. Install the CMake. Run it.
5.
